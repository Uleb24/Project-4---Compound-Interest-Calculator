# Project-4---Compound-Interest-Calculator
A small basic compound interest calculator I have created using simple code

 This compound calculator calculates your balance based on: 
 - Your principal amount (invested for example) (can be in decimals)
 - The Interest Rate (can be in decimals)
 - The time in years (can be in decimals indicating months/weeks based on the number of 0s)

This is my 4th basic project, the other ones I will probably get back to and work on once I learn more about Python and how to build actual useable programs with UIs and not just text files.
